# Change XXYYZZ to the UID of your Servo Brick

setup:
	# Configure two servos with voltage 5.5V
	# Servo 1: Connected to port 0, period of 19.5ms, pulse width of 1 to 2ms
	#          and operating angle -100 to 100°
	#
	# Servo 2: Connected to port 5, period of 20ms, pulse width of 0.95
	#          to 1.95ms and operating angle -90 to 90°
